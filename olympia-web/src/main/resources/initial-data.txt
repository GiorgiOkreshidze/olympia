# Note: For trainings, you'll need the actual IDs of the trainees/trainers generated by the application.
# For initial load, you might hardcode some IDs or create a more sophisticated loading mechanism.
# For demonstration, let's use placeholder IDs for now. In a real scenario, you'd typically
# load users first, then trainings that reference their generated IDs.
# For this example, I'll use some dummy UUIDs. In a real app, you'd get the actual IDs
# after saving the trainees/trainers.
